# Level Devil Wii
👀This project aims to create a port of the famous troll game "Level Devil" for Nintendo Wii;
for now, I will exclusively use C as the programming language.👀

- This version is currently just a test. I consider myself a beginner in Wii programming, so the project will likely progress slowly. I know the current sprites are quite ugly, but as I said at the beginning, they're just for testing. If you're a programmer or have experience in pixel art and are interested in helping make this project a reality, you can contact me via email (necrodev7@gmail.com).
