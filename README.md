# Level Devil Wii
👀This project aims to create a port of the famous troll game "Level Devil" for Nintendo Wii;
for now, I will exclusively use C as the programming language.👀


This version is currently just a test. I consider myself a beginner in Wii programming, so the project will likely progress slowly. I know the current sprites are quite ugly, but as I said at the beginning, they're just for testing. If you're a programmer or have experience in pixel art
and are interested in helping make this project a reality, you can contact me via email (necrodev7@gmail.com).

I promise to publish the game's source code in a few days. For now, I won't because it's a very basic version of the game and the code is quite messy. My goal is to implement a "Level Creator" to make level creation easier and more flexible.
 Currently, this is an experiment. The pre-alpha version will be as close as possible to the original game
 (except for the levels, which I want to make different).
